Sick of playing AAA games with $100+ million budgets with photorealistic visuals and enough content for a life time?
Well my friend, look no further as our game was made on a shoe string budget, with visuals..with a...retro feel!

I wouldnt' try and change perfection; however if you wish to try...it might not hurt if we had a bit more testing done.
Feedback on level difficulty for example won't be completely ignored..
Also, this was made with GameMaker 2.0 which is free of this writing to download and use.
Simply open the project after downloading from GitHub in GM 2.0 and play it after making your 'improvements'.

I'm a generous man. I know what I have, and after some serious thought, I realized this cannot be witheld from the nations.
Share and share bountifully. No license will stand in your way.

I'd like to thank George Washington for finding America so that I could be free to make this game.
